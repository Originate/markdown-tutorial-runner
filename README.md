TextRunner executes documentation written in Markdown,
similar to how a human reader would execute it if they were reading and following it.
It also ensures that links and images in your documentation point to existing targets.

There are no requirements how the executable documentation must look like:
You can execute embedded source code in any programming language
(that is available on your computer),
tables, bullet point lists,
as well as plain text in any human language.
An example is the document you are reading right now,
which is verified for correctness by TextRunner.

## Why you need it

* **evergreen tutorials:**
  your documentation is always correct,
  whether you change it or the product it describes
* **[semantic versioning](http://semver.org):**
  know whether a product change affects documented behavior
* **[readme-driven development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html):**
  documentation is your product prototype and drives the production implementation

## How it works

To make a part of a Markdown file actionable by TextRunner,
wrap it in an `<a>` tag with class `tr_[action name]`.
As an example,
let's say a tutorial tells the reader to create a file `config.yml`
with the content `foo: bar`.
The markdown code of this tutorial might look something like this:

```markdown
## Creating a configuration file

Please create a file with the name __config.yml__ and the content:
`窶義`
foo: bar
`窶義`
```

To make this part of the documentation executable,
surround it with an `<a>` tag that specifies that we want to create a file:

<a class="tr_runMarkdownInTextrun">

```markdown
## Creating a configuration file

<a class="tr_createFile">
Please create a file with the name __config.yml__ and the content:
`窶義`
foo: bar
`窶義`
</a>
```

</a>

The class `tr_createFile` tells TextRunner to run the `createFile` action here,
which makes it create a file in its working directory.
It takes the filename and content to create from the text inside this block
(not invisible metadata, but the document's content which the user sees),
and creates the specified file.
Text outside of `<a>` tags is ignored by TextRunner.

Now run `text-run` on the command line to test this document.
TextRunner creates a file <a class="tr_verifyWorkspaceFileContent">_config.yml_
with the content `foo: bar`</a> in a subfolder of your current directory called `tmp`.

## Built-in Actions

TextRunner provides a number of built-in actions
for activities typically performed in software documentation.

#### Filesystem

All file system actions happen inside a special directory called the _workspace_.
This directory is located in `./tmp` unless [configured otherwise](#configuration).

* [change the current working directory](documentation/actions/cd.md)
* [create a directory](documentation/actions/create_directory.md)
* [create a file](documentation/actions/create_file.md)
* [verify a directory exists](documentation/actions/verify_workspace_contains_directory.md)
* [verify a file with given name and content exists](documentation/actions/verify_workspace_file_content.md)

#### Verify the Git repo that contains the documentation

* [display the content of a file in the Git repo](documentation/actions/verify_source_file_content.md)
* [link to a directory in the Git repo](documentation/actions/verify_source_contains_directory.md)

#### Console commands

Console commands also happen in TextRunner's [workspace directory](#filesystem).
* [run a console command](documentation/actions/run_console_command.md)
* [start and stop long-running console commands](documentation/actions/start_stop_console_command.md)
* [verify the output of the last console command](documentation/actions/verify_run_console_command_output.md)

#### Running source code

* [run Javascript code](documentation/actions/run_javascript.md)

#### Other actions

* [required NodeJS version](documentation/actions/minimum-node-version.md)
* [verify NPM installation instructions](documentation/actions/verify_npm_install.md)
* [verify global command provided by NPM module](documentation/actions/verify_npm_global_command.md)

With the option `--fast` given, text-run does not check outgoing links to other websites.

## Custom actions

Let's create a custom action aka type of block that we can use in our documentation.
All it does is print "hello world" in the test runner's console output when running.
It will be triggered via this piece of Markdown:

<a class="tr_createMarkdownFile">

```html
<a class="tr_helloWorld"></a>
```
</a>

When TextRunner encounters this block type,
it runs the method that the file <a class="tr_createFile">__text-run/hello-world-action.js__ exports.
Notice that the file name must use [kebab-case](http://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase).
Let's create this file with the content:

```javascript
module.exports = function({ formatter }) {
  formatter.start('greeting the world')   // start the "greeting the world" activity type
  formatter.output('Hello world!')        // print something on the console
  formatter.success()                     // finish the started activity
};
```

</a>

<a class="tr_runTextrun">
The formatter displays test progress on the console as the test runs:
</a>

<img src="documentation/async.gif" width="460" height="134" alt="output demonstration">

The handler function for our action is given an object containing various information and utility functions:

<!-- TODO: check this by creating a custom action that lists the arguments given to it -->
* __filename__, __startLine__, __endLine:__ location of the currently executed block in the documentation
* __nodes:__ the document content inside the `<a>` tag for this action,
  as an array of [AST nodes](#ast-nodes)
* __searcher:__ a utility that makes it easier to get content out of those AST nodes ([documentation](#the-searcher-helper))
* __formatter:__ the [Formatter](#formatter) instance to use, for signaling test progress and console output to TextRunner
* __configuration:__ TextRunner configuration data (which TextRunner options are enabled)
* __runner:__ the currently running handler function

TextRunner supports all forms of synchronous and asynchronous operations:
* just do something synchronous ([example](examples/custom-action-sync)) -
  don't worry that synchronous operations prevent concurrency by blocking Node's event loop,
  all TextRunner steps are run strictly sequentially anyways
* return a Promise  <!-- TODO: example -->
* implement the action as a modern
  [async function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)
  <!-- TODO: example -->
* take a callback function as a second parameter to your handler function and call it when you are done
  ([example](examples/custom-action-async))

You can write the handler in any language that transpiles to JavaScript,
for example [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io),
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org),
or [LiveScript](http://livescript.net).
Just make sure that your project contains a local installation of your transpiler,
since TextRunner does not find globally installed transpilers.
This means your project should have a `package.json` file listing the transpiler you want TextRunner to call,
in addition to any other NPM modules that your handler method uses.


### AST Nodes

Document content is provided as [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) nodes.
Each node is an object that has these attributes:
* __line:__ the line in the file at which this AST node begins
* __type:__ the type of the AST node
* __content:__ textual content of the AST node
* __src:__ the content of the `src` attribute if this AST node is a link or image
* __level:__ if this AST node was nested in another one, the nesting level


### Formatter

One of the utilities availabe to actions is the formatter instance.
It allows to signal test progress to TextRunner and print test output to the console.

Call `formatter.start(<activity name>)` before you run an activity.
This tells TextRunner that whatever happens next (output, success, failure) is part of that activity.

`formatter.output(text)` allows to print output of the currently running action
on the console. Depending on the type of formatter, this output is printed or not.

When the test succeeds, call `formatter.success()`.
If it fails, call `formatter.error()` with the error message.

TextRunner supports a variety of formatters:

* __detailed formatter:__
  Prints each test performed, including test output.

* __dot formatter:__
  A minimalistic formatter, shows only dots for each test performed.


### the "searcher" helper

More realistic tests for your documentation
will need to access document content
in order to use it in tests.
The DOM nodes of the active block
including their type, content, and line number -
are provided to your handler function
via the the `nodes` field of the first argument.
You can access this data directly
or use a helper that is provided to you via the `searcher` field of the first parameter.
To demonstrate how this works,
here is a simple implementation of an action that runs a code block in the terminal.

<a class="tr_createMarkdownFile">

```
<a class="tr_consoleCommand">
`窶義`
echo "Hello world"
`窶義`
</a>
```
</a>

Here is the block definition implemented using the `searcher` helper.

<a class="tr_createFile">

__text-run/console-command.js__
```javascript
child_process = require('child_process')

module.exports = function({formatter, searcher, nodes}) {

  // step 1: provide a first rough description of what this action does,
  // so that TextRunner can print a somewhat helpful error message
  // if loading more specific data below fails somehow
  formatter.start('running console command')

  // step 2: determine which command to run using the searcher utility
  // (you could also iterate the "nodes" array directly here but that's more cumbersome)
  const commandToRun = searcher.nodeContent({type: 'fence'}, function(match) {
    if (match.nodes.length === 0) return 'this block must contain a code block with the command to run'
    if (match.nodes.length > 1) return 'please provide only one code block'
    if (!match.content) return 'you provided a code block but it has no content'
  })

  // step 3: provide TextRunner a specific description of this action
  formatter.refine('running console command: ' + commandToRun)

  // step 4: perform the action
  formatter.output(child_process.execSync(commandToRun, {encoding: 'utf8'}))

  // step 5: tell TextRunner that this action worked and we are done here
  formatter.success()
}
```
</a>

<a class="tr_runTextrun"></a>

The `searcher.nodeContent` method returns the content of the DOM node
that satisfies the given query.
In this case we are looking for a fenced code block,
hence the query is `{type: 'fence'}`.
Providing an array for the type (e.g. `{type: ['code', 'fence']}`)
retrieves all nodes that have any of the given types.

The second parameter is an optional validation method.
Its purpose is to make it easy and readable to provide specific error messages
that make your custom block definition user-friendly and easy to debug.
Its parameter is an object containing the content of the determined node
as well as an array of all the nodes that match the given query.
Strings returned by this method get printed as errors to the user and cause the test to fail,
falsy return values indicate that the validation has passed,


## Installation

- runs on macOS, Linux, Windows
- requires [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) version <a class="tr_minimumNodeVersion">8</a>
- create a `package.json` file in the root folder of your code base,
  for example by running `npm init -f` there
- add TextRunner by running <a class="tr_verifyNpmInstall">`npm install --dev text-runner`</a>
- in the root directory of your code base, run <a class="tr_verifyNpmGlobalCommand">`text-run`</a>


## Configuration

You can configure TextRunner via a configuration file.
To create one, run:

<a class="tr_runConsoleCommand">

```
$ text-run setup
````
</a>

The created configuration file <a class="tr_verifyWorkspaceFileContent">
__text-run.yml__ looks like this:

```yml
# white-list for files to test
files: '**/*.md'

# the formatter to use
format: detailed

# prefix that makes anchor tags active regions
classPrefix: 'tr_'

# whether to run the tests in an external temp directory,
# uses ./tmp if false,
# you can also provide a custom directory path here
useTempDirectory: false

# action-specific configuration
actions:
  runConsoleCommand:
    globals: {}
````

</a>

* the `files` key describes via a glob function which files are executed by TextRunner.
  It automatically ignores hidden folders as well as `node_modules`.

* the `actions` section contains configuration information specific to actions.
  Please see the documentation for the respective action for more details.

## Related Work

There are many other good testing tools out there.
They can be combined with TextRunner
or could be viable alternatives to it, depending on your use case:

* [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io):
  Runs tests via a specialized DSL that is optimized for describing features
  via user stories, acceptance criteria, and example scenarias.
  TextRunner and Cucumber complement each other,
  i.e. you would use TextRunner for the end-user facing documentation on your web site
  and Cucumber for agile, collaborative, behavior-driven day-to-day development,
  driven by TextRunner.

* [Gauge](http://getgauge.io):
  a "Cucumber for Markdown".
  Imposes a pretty strict format on the Markdown.
  With TextRunner there are no restrictions on how the Markdown has to look like;
  it can be 100% human-friendly prose.

* [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html):
  executes only actual code blocks in your documentation,
  and verifies only that it runs without errors.
  TextRunner is a superset of this tool,
  it can run anything that can be described textually,
  and verify it in arbitrary ways.

* [mockdown](https://github.com/pjeby/mockdown):
  like doctest, with verification of the output.
