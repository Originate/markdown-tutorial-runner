# Run a command on the console

- runs the command given in the code block in the workspace
- waits for the command to finish before continuing the test
- a `$` at the beginning of the line is ignored
- you can [configure](#calling-global-commands) global binaries that you your
  code base exports so that your test can call them directly

````markdown
<a textrun="run-console-command">

```
$ echo "hello world"
```

</a>
````

You can enter text into the running command by providing an HTML table with the
content to enter.

````markdown
<a textrun="run-console-command">

```
$ node greeter.js
```

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Mortimer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tuesday</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</a>
````

If the table contains multiple columns, the first column contains output to wait
for, and the last one text to enter once the output from the first column has
appeared. Middle columns are ignored. `<th>` elements are considered
descriptions and are also ignored.

````markdown
<a textrun="run-console-command">

```
$ node greeter.js
```

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>question</th>
    <th>description</th>
    <th>you enter</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Your name?</td>
    <td>the name of the person being greeted</td>
    <td>Mortimer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Current day of the week?</td>
    <td>enter any day name here</td>
    <td>Tuesday</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</a>
````

This code waits until the called program prints "Your name?", and enters
"Mortimer&lt;enter&gt;". Then it waits for "What does it do" and enters "Test
framework for documentation&lt;enter&gt;".

## Calling Global Commands

If you want to call a command provided by your code base, you have to tell
TextRunner the path to it. As an example, if your code provides an executable
called `tool`, and it is stored as `public/tool` in your source code,
<a textrun="verify-source-file-content"> your **text-run.yml** needs to contains
this section:

```
actions:
  runConsoleCommand:
    globals:
      tool: "public/tool"
```

The [global-tool](../examples/global-tool) folder contains a working version of
this configuration. </a>
