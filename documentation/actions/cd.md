The `cd` action changes into the directory that the link in its block points to.

<a class="tutorialRunner_runMarkdownInTutrun">
```markdown
<a class="tutorialRunner_cd">
Let's change into the [foo](.) directory to see what's in there.
</a>
```
</a>

The directory path should be a link
so that readers of your documentation can click to see it.
