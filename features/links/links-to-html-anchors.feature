Feature: links to HTML anchors

  As a tutorial writer
  I want to know whether links to other parts of the tutorial work
  So that I can reference releated sections.

  - dead links pointing to other parts of the same page or parts of other pages
    cause the test to fail


  Scenario: link to an existing anchor in the same file


  Scenario: link to an existing anchor in another file


  Scenario: link to a non-existing anchor in the same file


  Scenario: link to a non-existing anchor in another file
