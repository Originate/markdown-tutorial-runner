Feature: unknown activity types

    When using an active block for which there is no action
  I want to be notified
  So that I can add the missing custom action.

  - using an unknown action causes the test run to fail


  Scenario: using an unknown activity type
    Given my source code contains the file "1.md" with content:
      """
      <a textrun="unknown-action">
      </a>
      """
    When trying to run text-run
    Then the test fails with:
      | ERROR MESSAGE | unknown activity type: unknown-action |
      | FILENAME      | 1.md                                  |
      | EXIT CODE     | 1                                     |
    And it prints the error message:
      """
      Available built-in activity types:
      * cd
      * check-image
      * check-link
      * create-directory
      * create-file

      * verify-workspace-contains-directory

      No custom actions defined.

      To create a new "unknown-action" action,
      run "text-run add unknown-action"
      """
