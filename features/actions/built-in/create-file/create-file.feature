Feature: creating files with content

  As a tutorial writer
  I want to be able to create files with content
  So that my test suite has files to work with.

  - to create a file, wrap the code in an A tag with class "tutorialRunner_createFile"
  - the file name is provided in bold
  - content is provided as a triple-fenced code block


  Scenario: running a tutorial that creates files
    Given my workspace contains the file "creator.md" with the content:
      """
      <a class="tutorialRunner_createFile">
      creating a file with name __one.txt__ and content:

      ```
      Hello world!
      ```
      </a>
      """
    When running tut-run
    Then it signals:
      | FILENAME | creator.md            |
      | LINE     | 1-7                   |
      | MESSAGE  | creating file one.txt |
    And the test directory now contains a file "one.txt" with content:
      """
      Hello world!
      """


  Scenario: no file path given
    Given my workspace contains the file "creator.md" with the content:
      """
      <a class="tutorialRunner_createFile">
      ```
      Hello world!
      ```
      </a>
      """
    When trying to run tut-run
    Then the test fails with:
      | FILENAME      | creator.md                       |
      | LINE          | 1-5                              |

  Scenario: no content block given
    Given my workspace contains the file "creator.md" with the content:
      """

  Scenario: two file paths given
    Given my workspace contains the file "creator.md" with the content:
